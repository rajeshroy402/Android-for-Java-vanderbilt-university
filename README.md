# Android-for-Java-vanderbilt-university

In this repository, I've showcased my Java Development Skills and Android Studio skills.
The Week 1 has Logic code which showcases my understanding of Functions in Java
The Week 2 has a logic code where I developed an Android Single screen application which takes input of size in integer and ouputs a diamond skeleton pattern which is one of the popular designs on internet to solve
The Week 3 has a Java Logic where I created a Gate class which takes account of sheeps and their status (whether inside the gate or outside)
The Week 4 was really special because over there I developed my first modular program for Android Calculator.

The files can be opened in Android Studio > 3.0, I'll suggest you to take latest Android Studio application so that you do not land in Gradle sync issue.
